You Are The One!

She's the one who faces the odds,
Taking painstaking conditions and stressors;
A daily trail of toil luxury less,
To craft new empress and emperors.

She's the one who puts us on track,
Often sacrificing for us her career;
The affection is beyond our imagination,
She's not less than a warrior.

She's the one who can become both,
Partial and impartial in her ways;
Partial when we face any trouble and,
Impartial to correct us, to flourish our days.

She's the one who plays a lot of roles,
Merrier than comedy, faster than science;
Alert before alarm, sweeter than music,
Teacher like the nature and our dearest reliance.

No pen can pen down, no measures can measure,
The Greatness and Selflessness are vast for description;
Enough of 'She's the one' phrases,
For me, you and only you are the one!

Happy Mother's Day!
